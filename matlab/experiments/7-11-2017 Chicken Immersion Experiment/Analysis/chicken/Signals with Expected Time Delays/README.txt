All figures were generated using object_in_saline_expected_time_delays.m
The figures showcase the signal at different depths with a vertical line where the chicken is located (in time). 
The x axis is in time rather than distance, as the speed of light changes as it enters the saline. 
Subtract_maxdepth_baseline contains the figures in which the baseline used was the chicken at -10cm
Subtract_saline_baseline contains the figures in which the baseline used was the zero signal.
