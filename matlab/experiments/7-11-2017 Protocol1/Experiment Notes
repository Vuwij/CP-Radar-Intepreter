Changes to default settings of X4M03:
Set dacmax to 1400 (as this was the minimum dacmax that prevented signals from getting cut off). 
However always took one signal in which both dacmax and dacmin are at their default values (it is possible that when dacmax and dacmin are at default values, the SNR is maximized)

Saline preparation:
Amount of distilled water used:
9 * (1000 mL Â± 5%) = 9 L
Amount of salt used:
80.9854g
Saline Concentration:
8.09854/9=0.8998%

Details on step 7 (getting signal from a meat piece):
Distance to saline: 27.2cm
Size of meat:
