Conclusions:
Running plot_baseband_data.m provides us with figures.
From Figure 1, it is clear that the beginning of all three signals overlap. 
From Figure 3, the location of the peak is within 5cm of the actual distance to the target, even when the target signal overlaps with the TX/RX signal.
Therefore, the TX/RX coupling signal stays consistent enough between the baseline and the signal when the target was placed in front to subtract it off and isolate the peak due to the target. 

**It is very important to take a baseline to eliminate TX/RX coupling for each experimental setup.
You cannot reliably use baselines from other setups reliably, as there are small deviations in the signal*

*Obviously the baseline signal would be dependent on which settings you choose (ex. center frequency, DAC settings etc.). Baseline signal must be taken
with the same settings as the data."
