Data folders (each measurement was taken with 3 trials):
All the motion data (chirp, sinusoid, and patient) was taken at 25 frames per second for 30 seconds. 
chicken_water:
baseline-lowchicken: baseline with chicken at the bottom of the container
baseline-nochicken: baseline with no chicken in the container
baseline-nowater: baseline with the container with no watter
baseline-tableonly: baseline with the everything removed from the table (empty table)
baseline-zero: baseline taken outside with the radar directed at the air with no objects within 5m 
chirp_D-xcm_Ay: sinusoidal motion with the center of motion x cm below the surface of the water (at the center of motion, the surface of the chicken is x cm below the surface of the water) with an amplitude of y cm. The period of the motion is swept.
sinusoid_D-xcm_Ty_Az: sinusoidal motion with the center of motion x cm below the surface of the water (at the center of motion, the surface of the chicken is x cm below the surface of the water) with a period of y cm and an amplitude of zcm. 
patient_D-xcm: patient chest motion with the center of motion x cm below the surface of the water (at the center of motion, the surface of the chicken is x cm below the surface of the water)
static_D-xmm: static data with the surface of the chicken x mm below the surface of the water.
